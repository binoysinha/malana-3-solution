Tested on: Microsoft edge and Google chrome (windows 10)
Used Robot fonts for crisp typography
Have written the code for modern browsers with ES6 features and modern CSS
Have used location.reload to get updated state. Although, this could have avoided, but due to time constraints, went with this approach
Used pointerdown event handler to support multiple devices.
Have used fluid typography and rem units for responsiveness.

Callout:
Have used loading svg which I copied from codepen
Have reused some of existing css from my earlier POCs to speed up development.

Given extra time, I would have done:
1. Better UX with animations and transition.
2. Would have created SPA with routes, instead of using hidding containers.
3. Would have focussed more on accessibilty
4. Sanitizing input fields to avoid CSRF attacks.
5. Data persistency using local storage.
6. Could have focussed more on responsiveness
